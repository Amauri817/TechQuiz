# Tech Quiz

## Description 
In today's dynamic development environment, testing is not just an afterthought but a critical part of the development process that ensures applications meet user demands and perform efficiently under various conditions.

This week, you'll take the starter codebase of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhance it by adding Cypress for both component and end-`to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Installation
Download it from 'code', don't forget to "npm i"

## Usage
It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.

Your testing should use [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) to run both the component tests and the end-to-end tests. The testing will be invoked using the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
